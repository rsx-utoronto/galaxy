Using GitHub on Windows (with the app) by Jeff:
1) Download and install windows github client: https://windows.github.com/
2) Follow the setting up git tutorial: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
3) Clone a repository to your computer, you can use the Windows app you just installed: click the plus sign at the top left then choose clone then select the repository to clone.
4) Make sure that everything is synced, you can click the sync button at the top right to make sure.
5) Open the repository in windows explorer either manually or using the app.
6) Edit documents.
7) After editing, in the windows app it should show uncommitted changes. You can now add a summary and description and commit those changes.
8) After committing it will show that you have unsynced changes. You can sync at your convenience by hitting the sync button.
9) That's pretty much it.
10) You could also just use the shell, which the app will open for you.
